# Assembly String Encryption/Decryption Program

An individual project for the course 'Computer Architecture - Practicum' during the first semester of my second year in Sofia University, FMI

This program reads a string of length up to 200 symbols from a file, encrypts/decrypts the string and writes the result to an output file.
Each command (encrypt/decrypt/save) is issued by the user and is read from the console. The current condition of the string is also printed in the console after each encrypt/decrypt command.
 
Functionality
* Apply up to 3 levels of encryption to a string
* Decrypt an encrypted string to a lower level of encryption
* Write the current string condition to an output file
* Track level of encryption/decryption

Usage
* Press 1 to encrypt
* Press 2 to decrypt
* Press 3 to save to the output file

Note: The encryption algorithms are rather simple and easily reversible.
